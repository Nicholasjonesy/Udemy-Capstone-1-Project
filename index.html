    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I like solving problems and making things less complicated for people. Design is my avenue to help do that. To me, design is not just making a sub-par experience look good. Design is learning about people and their expectations and taking that knowledge to craft a good experience for them. This involves not just the “end-user”, but the business and engineers developing the product as well.</p>
